# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction (Machine Learning + Streamlit)

A complete end-to-end machine learning project that predicts **customer churn probability** using telecom customer data.  
The project includes:

- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training (Random Forest / XGBoost ready)
- Churn probability scoring
- A fully interactive **Streamlit dashboard**
- Exportable predictions (`data/test_scored.csv`)
- Production-ready modular project structure

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest revenue leaks in subscription-based businesses.  
This project builds a machine learning pipeline to:

- Identify customers likely to churn  
- Analyze key churn drivers  
- Support targeted retention strategies  
- Provide real-time scoring through an interactive app

The app allows users to upload data, view churn probabilities, inspect feature importance, and export predictions.
